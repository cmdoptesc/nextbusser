nextbusser
==========

nextbusser is a JavaScript library to query the NextBus API and parse the resulting XML data. Callbacks can be provided to the functions, or they will return a basic jQuery promise that will have the methods `.then()`, `.done()`, and `.fail()`.

An early version of nextbusser was used for my muniNow app:
